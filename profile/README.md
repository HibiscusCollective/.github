# Hibiscus Collective

Hi ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Hibiscus Collective!
This organisation is the libre software arm of [Hibiscus Games](https://www.github.com/HibiscusGames). 
The vision behind this initiative is that libre software is not incompatible with game development.
Indeed, we posit that the whole medium would benefit from a more open and collaborative approach rather than jealously guarded patents, secrets, etc.
By building openly, up front and always transparently we hope to build trust with the community and go on a journey of exploration together :rocket:

## How do I get involved?

The easiest way to get involved is to download/fork one of our projects, try it out and let us know what you think!
We're always keen to see what you can do with what we're building so please don't hesitate to share your project with us.

If you're so inclined, please feel free to fork one of the repositories and fix something that's bugging you, pick up an open ticket, design a logo or some icons, write some docs, any contribution is really appreciated.
That said, prior to investing your time and effort, please reach out on the github issues, or project discussions so we know someone's looking at that ticket and don't double up.
Additionally, we're not completely set up for contributions yet. 
We will definitely be asking you to relinquish intellectual property rights and patent claim rights to your contribution in order to protect the freedom of the project and our users and contributors.
The relevant contributor aggreement isn't drafted yet but please don't hesitate to signal your interest in any case and we'll get right on sorting that out.
In the meantime we'd advise holding off on doing any work while we iron out the contributor agreement to avoid disappointment should the terms not be agreeable to you.

## Code of conduct

Participation in this community is a privilege, not a right. It is contingent on doing your part to keep the community a healthy, safe and welcoming place.
This is a place of learning, experimentation and creation. We strive to foster a spirit of inquisitiveness and continuous, collaborative improvement.

A code of conduct is also a work in progress and we'll update this page when it is available. In a nutshell it boils down to these ideas/values:
1. **Everyone is deserving of respect and dignity regardless of their place of origin, physical and mental characteristics, sexuality, gender identity, etc.**
   We have a zero tolerance policy for hate speech, bullying, harassment and discrimination. **Offenders will be banned, you've been warned.**
2. **Bad people are very rare, bad systems are everywhere.**
   When a mistake is made, we don't point the finger of blame at each other. We seek to discover what we can learn from what happen and improve our systems and processes to prevent it reoccuring.
   **We have a no blame culture and we actively protect it.**
3. **Most people operate in good faith, even if we don't agree.** Disagreements are normal, and challenging each other's ideas is encouraged. But we keep things civil and about the idea, not the person.
   **Personal attacks, threats and trolling are not acceptable behaviour however, and will not be tolerated. Refer to point 1 above.**
4. **Feedback is a gift and an opportunity to grow and improve.**
   We don't shy away from giving or receiving feedback, even when it's uncomfortable. That said we strive to be kind and always seek consent before sharing constructive feedback.
   Good constructive feedback comes from a place of love, and should be intended to help the other person improve.
   But don't be shy about asking to postpone feedback if you aren't ready to receive it right now, it's okay to not be in the right headspace for it all the time. Be kind to you too.
5. **We hold each other to the same high standards, regardless of notoriety, role or experience.** 
   No one is above the guiding principles and policies governing how we work together. No one gets a pass on breaching them no matter who they are.
   It also follows that feedback or ideas from less experienced or newer contributors deserve just as serious consideration as those from the project founder.

In a nutshell, don't be a d**k and we'll get along just fine.

## Governance 

At the moment the governance does sit with one person (@pfouilloux), this is currently unavoidable due to this community being very small.
The intention is to hand over to a steering commmittee from the community as soon as the community grows to a size and level of activity where that becomes practical.
The aim is to foster a flat, egalitarian structure as much as possible. There is a need for well defined roles and ownership models to keep projects moving and well maintained. 
But ideally we should be able to rotate those roles within the community regularly rather than consolidate them within a small group.

## Policies, decisions and how to change them

The intent is not to constrain individual project teams' freedom to develop the project in the way that works best for them.
However a consistent framework of shared guidelines fosters better communication, and a minimal set of common guardrails promote a base level of security and reliabilty.
Individual projects may choose to introduce additional policies, and are expected to maintain their own decision records so long as they are not in conflict with the group-wide ones.

A tech radar is maintained [in this repository](../engineering/tech-radar.json) and is available to be viewed on the [Thoughtworks radar builder site](https://radar.thoughtworks.com/?sheetId=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fspreadsheets%2Fd%2F1GBX3-jzlGkiKpYHF9RvVtu6GxSrco5OYTBv9YsOTXVg%2Fedit%23gid%3D0)

Any policies applicable to the whole Hibiscus Collective will be [publicly available here](../policies).
Decision records for those policies, and any other group-wide concerns will be [publicly available here](../decisions)

Anyone is welcome to raise a concern requiring a decision and/or propose a new policiy following our [decision framework](,,/decision-framework.md)
All of these documents are open to be challenged and improvements proposed via the [same process](../decision-framework.md). This document too!
