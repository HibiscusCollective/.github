# Hibiscus Collective

Hi ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Hibiscus Collective!
This organisation is the libre software arm of [Hibiscus Games](https://www.github.com/HibiscusGames).
The vision behind this initiative is that libre software is not incompatible with game development.
Indeed, we posit that the whole medium would benefit from a more open and collaborative approach rather than jealously guarded patents, secrets, etc.
By building openly, up front and always transparently we hope to build trust with the community and go on a journey of exploration together :rocket:

## Code of conduct

Participation in this community is a privilege, not a right. It is contingent on doing your part to keep the community a healthy, safe and welcoming place.
This is a place of learning, experimentation and creation. We strive to foster a spirit of inquisitiveness and continuous, collaborative improvement.

Please follow our [Code of conduct](https://github.com/HibiscusCollective/.github/wiki/Code-of-Conduct) when interacting with each other in the community.

## How do I get involved?

The easiest way to get involved is to download/fork one of our projects, try it out and let us know what you think!
We're always keen to see what you can do with what we're building so please don't hesitate to share your project with us.

If you're interested in contributing in other ways, [please see the contribution guidelines](https://github.com/HibiscusCollective/.github/wiki/Contributing).

## Governance

At the moment the governance does sit with one person (@pfouilloux), this is currently unavoidable due to this community being very small.

[Please refer to the governance document](https://github.com/HibiscusCollective/.github/wiki/Governance) for what the future plans are to hand over direction to the community as it grows.

## Policies

The intent is to empower individual project teams' freedom to develop the project in the way that works best for them while providing a framework of shared guidelines and guardrails to promote a base level of consistency, security and reliability.

* We follow a [decision framework](https://github.com/HibiscusCollective/.github/wiki/POL%E2%80%900001%3A-Decision-Making-Process) to collectively and transparently make decisions.
* Our tech radar  is available to be viewed on the [Thoughtworks radar builder site](https://radar.thoughtworks.com/?sheetId=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fspreadsheets%2Fd%2F1GBX3-jzlGkiKpYHF9RvVtu6GxSrco5OYTBv9YsOTXVg%2Fedit%23gid%3D0)
