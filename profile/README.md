## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸšš I'm moving ðŸšš

Due to concerns and uncertainty over GitHub's future now that it's being folded into the CoreAI group at Microsoft, I'll be leaving the platform for now.
Note that this doesn't mean Microsoft has done or intends to do anything wrong, or that I won't be back once there's some clarity around what'll happen with GitHub.
It's just that from the outside it looks like the incentives are misaligned to keep GitHub a place where code can be hosted freely and shared between developers under
whichever license they choose without worrying about being commoditised as an AI training database. 

I'm a small fish so it's easy enough for me to pick up and go, so I'll be migrating Hibiscus Games, Hibiscus Collective, and my personal projects over to GitLab over the next couple of days.
Please come visit there if you're looking for me! I'm also taking this opportunity to rebrand as there's a lot more Hibiscus themed organisations around than I thought ðŸ˜….
Going forward, I'll be developing game projects as [Broken Shackle Games](https://gitlab.com/broken-shackle/games), and opens-source/other software projects as [Broken Shackle Software](https://gitlab.com/broken-shackle/libre)

I wish all the best to the folks who made GitHub what it is and anyone who chooses to stick around.
