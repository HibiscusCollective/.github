# Governance

The intention is to form a steering commmittee from the community as soon as the community grows to a size and level of activity where that becomes practical.
The aim is to foster a flat, egalitarian structure while acknowledging the need for well defined roles and ownership models to keep projects moving and well maintained.
The aim is to clearly define the responsibilities of each role and to rotate them within the community regularly.
