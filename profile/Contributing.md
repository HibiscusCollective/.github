# Contributing :construction: WIP :construction:

If you're so inclined, please feel free to fork one of the repositories and fix something that's bugging you, pick up an open ticket, design a logo or some icons, write some docs, any contribution is really appreciated.
That said, prior to investing your time and effort, please reach out on the github issues, or project discussions so we know someone's looking at that ticket and don't double up.

Additionally, we're not completely set up for contributions yet.
We will definitely be asking you to relinquish intellectual property rights and patent claim rights to your contribution in order to protect the freedom of the project and our users and contributors.

The relevant contributor agreement isn't drafted yet but please don't hesitate to signal your interest in any case and we'll get right on sorting that out.
In the meantime we'd advise holding off on doing any work while we iron out the contributor agreement to avoid disappointment should the terms not be agreeable to you.
