# Hibiscus Collective

This repository holds the github profile and discussions for the Hibiscus Collective as well as organisation-wide policies, guidelines and decision records.

It also hosts the scripts to measure our settings against the OpenSSF security scorecard and [best practices](https://best.openssf.org/SCM-BestPractices/).
