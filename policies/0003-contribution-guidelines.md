## Context and Problem Statement

The aim of this policy is to provide a default set of contribution guidelines for
Hibiscus collective projects. Individual projects may choose to operate differently
if that works better for them.
This excludes the [contributor agreement](0004-contributor-agreement.md), which **must** be the same for all projects.
It is strongly recommended to just link to the one in this repo instead of copying it.

## Effective date

This policy will come into effect immediately.
